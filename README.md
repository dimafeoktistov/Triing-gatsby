# Portfolio site with gatsby

This repository serves two purposes. I am making my portfolio website and practising my skills in React.js, Gatsby, GraphQL, RxJS and HTML5 with SCSS. At the present moment it is not fully developed, so it's under construction.

## Install

To start developing and install the site you should clone this repo with command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dimafeoktistov/Triing-gatsby.git
```

CD into the directory. Then install dependencies with npm or yarn (preferably):

```sh
yarn install
```

Then you can run it by:

```sh
gatsby develop
```

## Features

So far I installed typography.js into the project, SCSS, and made header animation that appear when you scrolling up and dissapper when you scrolling down.
